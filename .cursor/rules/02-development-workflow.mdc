# Development Workflow

## Scripts

Run these commands from the project root:

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production and generate sitemap
- `npm run build:with-prerender` - Build for production with pre-rendering
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Important Notes

- The site uses React Router for navigation
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements shadcn-ui component library
- Pre-rendering is handled with react-snap
- SEO metadata is managed with react-helmet-async
